        sentences (list): list of sentences to be trained on.
        vector_size (int): dimensionality of the embedding layer.

        negative (int): size of negative sampling.
        window (int): maximum distance between the current and

        cbow (bool): determines the training type; True is for CBOW,
            False is for Skip-gram.
